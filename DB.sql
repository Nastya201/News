Well, the line was long for that keynote speech: “Photographing Cats — It Looks Easy, but It’s Not.”\r\n\r\nDebunking the cat lady myth, it turns out, is easier said than done.\r\n\r\nThis was the first CatCon, billed as a celebration of the stylish side of cat fancying. More than 10,000 people crowded into a downtown convention hall here over the weekend to shop for cat-centric merchandise (for people, mostly), have their pictures taken with celebrity Internet cats (such as Lil Bub, famous for her dwarfism), and attend cat-focused panels and speeches (“Goodbye Dowdy, Hello Gorgeous: Debunking the Cat Lady Myth”).\r\n\r\nThere were also “caticure” stations, where Aveda technicians gave visitors manicures and decorated fingernails with cat stickers.\r\n\r\n“My goal is to break down the stereotype of the weird cat person,” said Susan Michals, a cable television producer who organized CatCon in her spare time. “There is a whole world of cat lovers out there.

When the CatCon doors opened at 9 a.m. Saturday, roughly 700 people were waiting with narrowed eyes in a line that stretched around the block. The bathrooms, which were sponsored by a low-dust, exotic-scented cat litter, quickly became gridlocked. A jam-packed cat adoption area had to be barricaded by benches to limit the flow of people.\r\n\r\nA ban on personal pets — no cats on leashes — rankled some attendees, but the cats would have been trampled in the teeming merchandise village, where about 100 vendors plied their wares.
